This repository contains my first Jupyter Notebook created for the Coursera course “Tools for Data Science.” The notebook includes basic Markdown practice, simple Python code, and introductory exercises required for the course.

The notebook covers an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown cells that include examples of data science languages and commonly used data science libraries, and some basic Python code as part of the exercises.

The tools used for this project are Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, Python, and Git with GitHub.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning progress in data science, practice using Jupyter Notebooks, and learn how to upload and organize files in GitHub.
